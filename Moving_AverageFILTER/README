🧠 What is a Moving Average Filter?
A Moving Average Filter is a simple low-pass filter that smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights long-term trends in data. It works by taking the average of a set number of recent samples (a "window") and outputting that average.

✅ Advantages
    ✔️ Simple to implement (just addition and division)
    ✔️ Good for noise reduction
    ✔️ No phase distortion in some applications (e.g. symmetrical filter)

❌ Limitations

    ❌ Can lag behind fast-changing signals (delayed response)
    ❌ Not great at preserving sharp edges or spikes
    ❌ All data points in the window are equally weighted — no preference for newer data

🔧 Use Cases in Embedded Systems
    Smoothing sensor data (e.g., temperature, accelerometer)
    Filtering ADC noise
    Displaying stable values on screens
    Preprocessing before derivative or threshold logic
